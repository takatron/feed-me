* Ruby version
`2.5.1`

Practicing Rails by making a personal use application that allows me to add recipes (ingredients, steps, and notes).
MVP:
- can create/update/delete recipes
- can create/update categories (not sure about how to handle overall deletion yet)
- can tag recipes to categories (1:many)
- can tag a level of difficulty (hardcoded easy, medium, hard)
- can view/filter recipes by: all, categories, levels of difficulty
- can sort by categories, levels of difficulty
- can add “notes” to recipes

Nice to Have:
- pagination is set to 5/page (I don’t have that many recipes right now)
- maybe I’ll do a “favourite” section
- maybe I’ll do a search
